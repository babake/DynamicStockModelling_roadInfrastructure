# DynamicStockModelling_roadInfrastructure
A set of scripts (developed in Matlab and R environment) to dynamically model the stocks and flows associated with road infrastructure in Norway. 
For getting a more in depth understanding of the scripts logics, please read the published scientific articles published at the Journal of Industrial Ecology with the title of "Machine Learning-Based Stocks and Flows Modeling of Road
Infrastructure". 

Please feel free to share you feedbacks, and if you are using my scripts, kindly cite my published works.

Best regards, Babak
